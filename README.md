Ponzi schemes prey on unwary people by making unreasonably large returns promises, frequently by using dishonest methods. To pay off earlier investors, these schemes use the funds of new investors, giving a false appearance of a profitable business. They are, however, unsustainable in the long run because they need a continuous inflow of fresh capital to keep the scheme running. When it becomes impossible to find new investors, the scheme ultimately fails, causing severe financial losses for many people. This study introduces an approach for detecting Ponzi schemes by using XGBOOST and GRU. The hybrid model makes use of opcode length and other additional opcode features such as unique opcode count and opcode count, for detecting possible fraudulent activities. The model also showcases potential and the power of feature engineering and the complexity of the model in detecting Ponzi schemes in an Ethereum smart contract.
